Integrating telecom with broader networks.

**Key Concepts:**
- OSI & TCP/IP: Physical to Application layer, IP, TCP, UDP, DNS, DHCP, NAT
- Routing & Switching: Ethernet, VLAN, STP, OSPF, BGP
- Wireless Networks: Wi-Fi (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax), Cellular architecture

**Why It Matters:** Telecom engineers need networking for end-to-end systems.

**Labs/Practice:** Configured VLANs and routing; analyzed Wi-Fi traffic.

**Tools Used:** Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, Wireshark.
