Understanding signals as the core of information transmission.

**Key Concepts:**
- Signal types (analog vs digital)
- Energy vs power signals
- Time domain vs frequency domain
- Bandwidth
- Noise (AWGN)
- SNR, BER

**Why It Matters:** Telecom is about transmitting information over noisy channels; this lesson teaches reliability in imperfect environments.

**Labs/Practice:** Simulated signal propagation and noise effects; measured SNR in basic transmission setups.

**Tools Used:** MATLAB, Wireshark for signal capture.
