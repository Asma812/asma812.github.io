Penetration Testing Report
==========================

Target: _2Million_ (Hack The Box)
---------------------------------

**Author:** Asma Neji**Date:** February 2026**Assessment Type:** Black‑Box / Capture The Flag (CTF‑style)**Objective:** Identify vulnerabilities, gain privileged access, and retrieve flags

1\. Executive Summary
---------------------

The target system _2Million_ was assessed to identify security weaknesses that could allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

During the assessment, multiple vulnerabilities were identified, including **insecure application logic**, **information disclosure**, and a **critical Linux kernel vulnerability (CVE‑2023‑0386)** that allowed **local privilege escalation to root**.

Successful exploitation resulted in full system compromise and access to sensitive files, including the root flag.

2\. Scope & Methodology
-----------------------

### Scope

*   Target IP: 10.129.xxx.xxx
    
*   Services assessed:
    
    *   Web application
        
    *   Linux operating system
        
    *   Local privilege boundaries
        

### Methodology

The assessment followed a standard penetration testing approach:

1.  **Reconnaissance**
    
    *   Service enumeration
        
    *   Web application analysis
        
2.  **Initial Access**
    
    *   Application logic abuse
        
    *   Credential and information discovery
        
3.  **Privilege Escalation**
    
    *   Local enumeration
        
    *   Kernel vulnerability analysis
        
4.  **Post‑Exploitation**
    
    *   Root access verification
        
    *   Flag retrieval
        

3\. Findings & Exploitation Summary
-----------------------------------

### 3.1 Web Application Weaknesses

**Finding:** Insecure application logic and exposed functionality

*   The web application allowed unintended actions without proper authorization checks.
    
*   Sensitive endpoints and administrative functionality were discoverable.
    

**Impact:**This allowed an attacker to gain an authenticated shell as a low‑privileged user on the system.

**Risk Level:** Medium

### 3.2 Information Disclosure

**Finding:** Sensitive internal information exposed

*   Emails, internal identifiers, and system hints were accessible.
    
*   One exposed email address (ch4p@2million.htb) provided valuable context for further enumeration.
    

**Impact:**Information disclosure significantly reduced the attack complexity and guided later exploitation.

**Risk Level:** Medium

### 3.3 Local Privilege Escalation (Critical)

**Finding:** Vulnerable Linux kernel – OverlayFS

*   The system was running a Linux kernel vulnerable to **CVE‑2023‑0386**.
    
*   This vulnerability allows attackers to **move files within the Overlay filesystem while preserving metadata**, including:
    
    *   File ownership
        
    *   SetUID bit
        

**CVE Details**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE‑2023‑0386
    
*   **Type:** Local Privilege Escalation
    
*   **Affected Component:** OverlayFS
    
*   **Severity:** Critical
    

**Impact:**A local attacker can escalate privileges from a standard user to **root**, resulting in **full system compromise**.

**Risk Level:** 🔴 Critical

4\. Post‑Exploitation
---------------------

After successful privilege escalation:

*   Root access was obtained
    
*   System integrity was fully compromised
    
*   Sensitive files were accessible
    
*   The root flag was retrieved from /root/
    

This confirms a **complete compromise of the target system**.

5\. Impact Assessment
---------------------

If exploited in a real‑world environment, this vulnerability chain could lead to:

*   Full server takeover
    
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive data
    
*   Persistence installation
    
*   Lateral movement within internal networks
    
*   Total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability
    

6\. Recommendations & Mitigations
---------------------------------

### Immediate Actions

*   🔧 **Update the Linux kernel** to a version patched against CVE‑2023‑0386
    
*   🚫 Restrict OverlayFS usage where not required
    

### Web Application Hardening

*   Implement strict authorization checks
    
*   Remove exposed administrative functionality
    
*   Sanitize and restrict sensitive endpoints
    

### Monitoring & Defense

*   Enable:
    
    *   File integrity monitoring
        
    *   Privilege escalation detection
        
    *   Kernel exploit detection (EDR/XDR)
        
*   Regular vulnerability scanning and patch management
    

7\. Conclusion
--------------

The _2Million_ machine demonstrates how **chained vulnerabilities** — from weak application logic to unpatched kernel flaws — can result in **full system compromise**.

This assessment highlights the importance of:

*   Secure application design
    
*   Least privilege principles
    
*   Timely system patching
    
*   Continuous security monitoring
