title: Lesson 3: Signals & Systems (Core Telecom Brain)
permalink: /lesson3/
---
Mastering system behaviors for signal processing.

**Key Concepts:**
- Continuous-time vs discrete-time systems
- LTI systems
- Impulse response
- Sampling theorem (Nyquist)
- Aliasing
- Filtering (LPF, HPF, BPF)
- Analog-to-digital & digital-to-analog conversion

**Why It Matters:** This forms the "brain" of telecom engineering, enabling design of efficient systems.

**Labs/Practice:** Implemented filters and sampling in labs; avoided aliasing in digital signal experiments.

**Tools Used:** MATLAB, Python (SciPy), Simulink.
