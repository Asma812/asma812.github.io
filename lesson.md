## Lesson 2: Signals & Systems (Core Telecom Brain)
Mastering system behaviors for signal processing.

**Key Concepts:**
- Continuous-time vs discrete-time systems
- LTI systems
- Impulse response
- Sampling theorem (Nyquist)
- Aliasing
- Filtering (LPF, HPF, BPF)
- Analog-to-digital & digital-to-analog conversion

**Why It Matters:** This forms the "brain" of telecom engineering, enabling design of efficient systems.

**Labs/Practice:** Implemented filters and sampling in labs; avoided aliasing in digital signal experiments.

**Tools Used:** MATLAB, Python (SciPy), Simulink.

This is the bridge from pure math (Lesson 1) to actual telecom engineering.  
Signals & Systems is where you start thinking like a telecom engineer: how do we process, sample, filter, and digitize signals without losing (or corrupting) the information?

This topic is foundational for **digital communications**, **RF/wireless**, **cellular networks**, and almost every tool & project later (MATLAB, GNU Radio, srsRAN, etc.).

## Why Signals & Systems Is the "Core Brain" of Telecom

- Real-world signals are **continuous-time analog** (voice, radio waves).  
- Modern telecom is almost entirely **digital** after the antenna.  
- To go from analog → digital reliably → you need sampling, quantization, filtering, and system analysis.  
- Every modulation scheme, equalizer, channel estimator, beamformer, etc., is built on LTI system theory.  
- Skip or rush this → you'll understand *what* OFDM or QAM does, but not *why* it survives multipath or noise.

## 1. Continuous-Time vs Discrete-Time Systems

- **Continuous-time** (analog): Signals defined for all real t  
  Example: s(t) = cos(2π·1000·t)  
  Systems process them continuously (analog filters, amplifiers).

- **Discrete-time** (digital): Signals only at integer multiples of sampling period  
  x[n] = x(n·Tₛ), n = …, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …  
  Processed by DSP chips, FPGAs, software (Python/MATLAB).

**Telecom reality**  
RF front-end is analog/continuous → baseband processing is discrete/digital.  
5G NR, Wi-Fi 6, LTE → massive digital signal processing at baseband.

## 2. LTI Systems (Linear Time-Invariant) — The Golden Assumption

Almost every telecom system we analyze is modeled as **LTI**:

- **Linear**: Scaling + superposition  
  ax₁(t) + bx₂(t) → a·y₁(t) + b·y₂(t)
- **Time-Invariant**: Time shift in input → same time shift in output

**Why LTI is huge in telecom**

- Filters (channel filters, anti-aliasing, matched filters)  
- Channels themselves (in many models, especially AWGN)  
- Equalizers, interpolators, beamformers  
- Allows powerful math: convolution, frequency response, z-transform/DFT

## 3. Impulse Response — The DNA of an LTI System

The **impulse response** h(t) or h[n] completely characterizes an LTI system.

- Input: δ(t) (Dirac delta) → Output: h(t)  
- For any input x(t):  
  y(t) = x(t) * h(t)    (convolution)

- Discrete case:  
  y[n] = ∑ₖ x[k] · h[n-k]

**Intuition**  
h(t) tells you "how the system rings" after a sharp impulse.

**Telecom examples**

- Matched filter (optimal receiver in AWGN): h(t) = conjugate time-reversed transmitted pulse  
- Multipath channel impulse response: multiple delayed copies → causes ISI  
  → solved by OFDM or adaptive equalizers

**Example: Impulse response of a simple RC low-pass filter** (exponential decay — classic "memory" of the filter)

## 4. Sampling Theorem (Nyquist-Shannon) — The Most Important Rule in Digital Telecom

**Theorem**  
If a signal is bandlimited to maximum frequency fₘₐₓ (no energy above fₘₐₓ),  
then sampling at  
**fₛ ≥ 2·fₘₐₓ**  
perfectly reconstructs the original signal (using ideal sinc interpolation).

- **Nyquist rate** = 2·fₘₐₓ  
- **Nyquist frequency** = fₛ / 2

**Telecom examples**

- Audio: human hearing ~20 kHz → CD uses 44.1 kHz  
- 5G baseband: channels up to 100–400 MHz → sampling rates in Gsamples/s in high-end radios

**Visual: Proper sampling vs aliasing** (sine wave example)

![Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem Illustration](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*WDxtduQB2iQqdGM9HNvScA.png)  
*Left: Proper sampling (fₛ > 2×f_max) reconstructs perfectly. Right: Undersampling causes aliasing.*

## 5. Aliasing — The Enemy You Must Understand

When fₛ < 2·fₘₐₓ, frequencies above fₛ/2 fold back into the baseband:

f_alias = |f - k·fₛ|   (for integer k that brings it into [-fₛ/2, fₛ/2])

**Consequence**  
High-frequency components masquerade as low-frequency ones → irreversible distortion.

**Prevention in real systems**

- Always apply **anti-aliasing low-pass filter** before ADC  
  Cutoff frequency ≤ fₛ / 2  
- In software-defined radio: digital down-conversion + careful decimation

## 6. Filtering: LPF, HPF, BPF

Filters remove unwanted frequencies.

| Filter Type       | Passes                     | Attenuates                  | Telecom Use Case                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Low-Pass (LPF)    | Below cutoff               | Above cutoff                | Anti-aliasing, baseband signal extraction     |
| High-Pass (HPF)   | Above cutoff               | Below cutoff                | Remove DC offset, low-frequency noise         |
| Band-Pass (BPF)   | Between f₁ and f₂          | Outside the band            | Channel selection in receiver                 |

**Example frequency responses** (magnitude and phase for Butterworth-style filters)

## 7. Analog-to-Digital & Digital-to-Analog Conversion (ADC / DAC)

**ADC chain**

1. Anti-aliasing LPF  
2. Sample-and-hold  
3. Quantization (→ quantization noise)  
4. Encoding (binary)

**DAC**: reverse process + reconstruction filter (smooth stair-steps)

**Key impairments in telecom**

- Quantization noise (increases with fewer bits)  
- Aperture jitter (critical at high sampling rates)  
- Dynamic range requirements → 12–16 bit ADCs common in base stations
